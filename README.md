Source code: We used as root the excellent piece of code from Dheera Venkatraman (http://dheera.net/) on https://github.com/dheera/android-wearcamera
Then just tweaked a bit to make the handeled side UI of the app as discreete as possible for spying purposes.
We also changed the gradle to add compile /"com.android.support:support-v4:20.0.+"/, seems to make less crashy when the phone receives notifications
As a benefic side effect it fixed some of the original version crashes
